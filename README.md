### How to contribute

You can contribute by adding new visual music programming languages or updating existing entries in the table found in the `README.md` file.

#### To add a new entry

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Open the `README.md` file in your fork.
3. Scroll to the table under “A repository of visual music programming languages”.
4. Add a new row at the end of the table using this format:

   ```markdown
   | Name | Initial release | Stable release | Description | Licence | Link |
   |------|------------------|----------------|-------------|---------|------|
   | ExampleLang | 2005 | 2023 | A modular environment for visual music composition | GPL-3.0 | https://example.com |
   ```

   - Use the full name of the language.
   - Include the year of the first and most recent stable release, if known.
   - Keep the description short and factual.
   - Specify the licence clearly (e.g. MIT, GPL-3.0, proprietary).
   - Use a reliable link—preferably the official website or an archived version via https://web.archive.org.

5. Commit your changes with a message (e.g. `Add ExampleLang to table`).
6. Open a pull request to the main repository.

#### To amend an existing entry

1. Follow steps 1–2 above.
2. Find the row you want to update in the table.
3. Edit the relevant fields, keeping formatting consistent.
4. Commit your changes with a message like `Update release info for Pure Data`.
5. Open a pull request.

#### Best practice

- Keep descriptions concise and neutral.
- Avoid promotional or subjective language.
- Use consistent formatting (e.g. capitalisation, spacing, link style).
- Prefer archived links to reduce risk of link rot.

If you're unsure about a change, feel free to open an issue to discuss it first.
